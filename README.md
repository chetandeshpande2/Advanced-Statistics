This project covers advanced statistical analysis across diverse scenarios:

Probability & Contingency Tables: Calculated injury probabilities for soccer players by position (e.g., 61.7% injury rate).

Bayesian Inference: Estimated radiation leak probabilities (37%) in nuclear accidents by cause (fire, mechanical failure, human error).

Normal Distribution: Analyzed breaking strength of gunny bags (e.g., 11% below 3.17 kg/cm²) and exam grades (75% pass cutoff = 82.73).

Hypothesis Testing: Validated a fitness program’s success (p=0.029) and assessed dentist impact on dental implant hardness (ANOVA assumptions checked).
